## Overview

**Project Title**: 

**Project Description**: 

**Project Goals**: Set up my environment to use TypeScript, download any necessary extensions or packages in VSCode. Create a HelloWorld project to make sure it works correctly. Study each of the 5 requirements and stretch requirement for the TypeScript module.
I will need Node and Express.js. I plan to work with VSCode as my IDE. I have already worked with Node, so that should be simple to set up and start. I have yet to learn about Express.js so I will need to find out any extensions to download or packages to install.
I will also need to know the differences - if any - between TypeScript and Javascript.
The topics will you learn first to build a good foundation.
Express.js, TypeScript, more about Node.
Classes, Arrays, and Tuples. I have worked with variables, functions, and data types already. The three topics I mentioned at the beginning of this statement will be my focus for enhancing my abilities in JS and TS.
The days, times, and locations you plan to practice. Consider practicing on most days of the Sprint.
I plan to start my project, or studying for my project, tomorrow. I want to practice each day after I work. Starting around 6:30.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Commands to initialize and install needed packages/extensions.
mkdir ts-crud-api -> Makes directory to work in.
cd ts-crud-api -> Navigates to needed directory
npm init -y -> Generates needed package.json file with default settings.
npm install -g express -> Globally "-g" installs express.js which interacts with Node. Updates package.json and package-lock.json to include express as a dependency for this project.
npm install --save-dev typescript ts-node-dev @types/express -> Installs typescript, installs ts-node, which allows the program to regenerate automatically when you save the file. Installs TypeScript definitions for Express, helps with error detection. save-dev ensures that correct packages are installed.
npx tsc --init -> Initializes tsconfig.json file which controls the TypeScript compiler. This controls what files are included and other specific compiler settings.
